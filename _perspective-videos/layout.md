## What is "Clear Layout and Design"? {#what}

The different parts of a web page must be easy to locate and identify.
This includes navigation menus, links, and text sections. These should
be at predictable locations and consistently identified. Also form
labels and instructions have to be clearly associated with their
controls.

## Who depends on this feature? {#who}

-   People with low vision who are using screen magnification and only
    see a portion of the screen at a time.
-   People with cognitive and learning disabilities who need clarity and
    consistency to orient themselves on a website.

## What are the additional benefits? {#others}

-   Content is more usable for people who are new to the particular
    website or application.
-   Content is more usable for people who are not confident using
    computers and the web.
-   Content is more usable for mobile device users who are seeing it on
    smaller screens, especially if they are in a hurry or distracted.
-   Content and functionality is easier to locate and identify by most
    users.

## What needs to happen for this to work? {#action}

Design clear structure, both visually and through the markup. For
example, make it easy to distinguish sections such as navigation, group
related controls in a form, and provide headers to identify groups of
information. Provide consistent presentation and behavior of web pages
across a website.

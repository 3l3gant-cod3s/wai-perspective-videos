What is "Understandable Content"? {#what}
---------------------------------

Content must be easy to follow and understand for many users. For most
content, this means simply avoiding overly complex sentences and jargon,
and providing clear layout and design. For some complex content such as
medical information, separate, easy-to-read information may be
necessary.

Who depends on this feature? {#who}
----------------------------

-   People with learning disabilities who cannot understand complex
    sentence structures and vocabulary.
-   People with cognitive disabilities who have difficulty focusing on
    long passages of dense text.

What are the additional benefits? {#others}
---------------------------------

-   Content is more usable for people with lower language skills, such
    as people who are not fluent in the language of the website and
    people with low literacy.
-   Content is easier to understand by users who are not familiar with
    the topic.
-   Content is easier to skim, and get an overview of the information.

What needs to happen for this to work? {#action}
--------------------------------------

Avoid overly complex words, jargon, and acronyms, or provide
explanations when they need to be used. Provide structure using
headings, lists, and spacing. Provide illustrations that clarify the
content, when helpful. Provide [clear layout and design]({{ site.github.url }}{% link _perspective-videos/layout.md %})
with consistent orientation and navigation cues.

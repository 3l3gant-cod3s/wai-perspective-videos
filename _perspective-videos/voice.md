What is "Voice Recognition"? {#what}
----------------------------

Voice recognition can be used for dictating text in a form field, as
well as navigating to and activating links, buttons, and other controls.
Most computers and mobile devices today have built-in voice recognition
functionality. Some voice recognition tools allow complete control over
computer interaction, allowing users to scroll the screen, copy and
paste text, activate menus, and perform other functions.

Who depends on this feature? {#who}
----------------------------

-   People with physical disabilities who cannot use the keyboard or
    mouse.
-   People with chronic conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries
    (RSI), who need to limit or avoid using the keyboard or mouse.
-   People with cognitive and learning disabilities who need to use voice
    rather than to type.

What are the additional benefits? {#others}
---------------------------------

-   Content works for people with temporary limitations, such as a
    broken arm.
-   Content is more usable for people who prefer to speak rather than
    type, for example, while multi-tasking.

What needs to happen for this to work? {#action}
--------------------------------------

Content must be properly designed and coded so that it can be controlled by voice. [keyboard compatibility]({{ "/perspective-videos/keyboard/" | relative_url }}) is the basis for such coding. In addition, labels and identifiers for controls in the source code need to match their visual presentation, so that it is clear which voice command will activate a control.
